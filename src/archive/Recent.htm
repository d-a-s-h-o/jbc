    On Thursday 23rd March, 2000, in University College Cork (UCC), I gave a talk entitled:

</p>
  
<p style = "margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;" align = "center">

     Could there exist a sixth Fermat prime? <em>I believe it is not impossible.

    An abstract</strong>:

</p>
  
<p> <font size = "3">

    Fermat believed the Fermat numbers {F[n]} (F[n]  =  2^(2^n) + 1) to be prime for all n  =  0,1,2,3,...), but, as is well known, they are prime 
    for n  =  0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, and for no other known value of n. An orthodoxy has now developed that F[n] is composite for all n&gt;4, but with not 
    the remotest sign of any proof. Only in September 1999 did Richard Crandall's team settle that F[24] is composite (now the smallest
    undecided case is F[31]), and last July - as a participant in Yves Gallot's Proth Prime Search - I fortuitously discovered the largest known 
    composite Fermat number, F[382447] (having more than 10<sup>100000</sup> digits). Last March I rediscovered a generally unknown unification of 
    Fermat and Mersenne numbers, an outcome of which was to make an observation which - I believe (though my point of view has opponents) - should 
    cause open-minded people to question the above orthodoxy. This talk will be of an entirely elementary nature, and will be suitable for undergraduate 
    students.

    To mark the 400<sup>th</sup>anniversary (on 17<sup>th</sup> August 2001) of the birth of Pierre de Fermat I presented a survey paper &#150; 
    using Maple &#150; on his renowned 'little' theorem.

    - Fermat's <em>little</em> theorem - at the 5<sup>th</sup> International Conference - 6<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> August 2001 -on the

    fundamental theorem, but mainly because of the time coincidence that August 17<sup>th</sup> 2001 will be the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 
    Fermat's birth.
