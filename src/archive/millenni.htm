Dear colleagues/friends,

<br>

<br>

I am writing to inform you of a forthcoming booklet of mine (published by Máiréad and Tim Robinson&#146;s 

<a href = "http://www.iol.ie/~tandmfl">Folding Landscapes</a>, 

my royalties for which I am donating to the Irish Cancer Society (Mr. James Cassidy, Irish Cancer Society, 5 Northumberland Rd, Dublin 4). 
Tim Robinson (artist, author, cartographer) will be known to many of you; less well known, perhaps, is that Tim Robinson studied Mathematics 
in Cambridge, England, in the mid-50&#146;s. The booklet Folding Landscapes are publishing is called <i>A Prime for the Millennium</i>, and Folding
Landscapes&#146; announcement about it may be viewed 

<a href = "http://www.iol.ie/~tandmfl/mprime.htm">here</a>.

The booklet may be ordered directly from 

<a href = "http://www.iol.ie/~tandmfl/mprime.htm">Folding Landscapes</a>, 

though it will also be on sale in some bookshops (there will be a launch in 

<a href = "http://www.kennys.ie">Kenny&#146;s Bookshop, Galway</a>, 

on Friday 3<sup>rd</sup> December 1999). Please feel free to circulate this to anyone whom you think might be interested.

Overnight last January 6<sup>th</sup>/7<sup>th</sup> I discovered - using mathematical ideas from 1914 of H.C. Pocklington and 

<a href = "http://www.maplesoft.com">Maple</a> 

software - what I called a &#145;millennium&#146; prime, namely a prime number with exactly 2000 digits. Ivars Peterson, the mathematics 
columnist with the US weekly publication 

<a href = "http://www.sciencenews.org/">Science News</a>, 

devoted his column in the issue of 16<sup>th</sup> January to it (his article may be read 

<a href = "http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc99/1_16_99/mathland.htm">here</a>),

and the Fall 1999, 12-page issue of The Maple Reporter devoted its central pages to an article about this millennium prime (based on a Maple 
worksheet of mine &#150; mill_pri.mws - which may be viewed 

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/Maple_3rd_year.htm">here</a>). &nbsp;

On January 7<sup>th</sup> I sent an announcement about it to the moderated Number Theory Mailing List (based at the University of North Dakota), 
and it may be viewed 

<a href = "https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind9901&L=NMBRTHRY&P=R2&1=NMBRTHRY&9=A&J=on&d=No+Match%3BMatch%3BMatches&z=4">here</a>,

On January 8<sup>th</sup> I wrote a long email to a niece (Jo) and nephew (Ben) about this discovery, told them <em>why</em> I wanted to
explain it to them, and gave them an <em>accessible explanation</em> (based on what I felt was their intellectual level) which necessarily 
cut some corners. It was meant to give them some idea as to how mathematical discoveries (and discoveries, perhaps, in general)
are made. At the time that was that.

This summer, as you may know, I was the fortunate joint discoverer &#150; with Yves Gallot - of the &quot;

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/fermat.htm">largest known composite Fermat number</a>, &quot;

and one of the many people who mailed me to offer congratulations (rightly due to Yves Gallot) was the well known cartographer/writer 
Tim Robinson. (Readers of his books will know that he studied mathematics at Cambridge, England.) With his note he attached an advanced copy 
of an article he had written, about prime numbers, for Marie Heaney&#146;s <em>Sources</em> (which has just been published by Town House, 
Dublin; royalties to Focus Point). I sent him back a lengthy commentary, and forwarded to him the January email - which contained nothing 
of a private nature - I had written to Jo and Ben. Within a few days he sought my permission to publish this email - with title 
<i>A Prime for the Millennium</i> - as Folding Landscapes&#146; contribution to millennia literature.

Prime Minister Blair today announced that as part of his plan to encourage closer relations between Britain and Ireland, the just
discovered &quot;prime of the millennium&quot; (as it has been dubbed by the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern (who went to school 
in the grounds of the College in which the Irish mathematician actually works)) will be printed on specially commissioned wallpaper to
grace the walls of the Millennium Dome. The leader of the Conservatives, William Hague, immediately criticised the PM&#146;s remarks, 
and wanted an enquiry established to determine why a British prime could not be used instead; he declared it was &quot;yet another prime 
example of falling educational standards under the New Labour government.&quot; The Irish government diplomatically pointed out that the 
Irish mathematician actually has an English wife, and insisted that the discovered prime was in fact a joint effort. A spokesperson denied 
reports that the wife has unplugged the computer to prevent any more primes being discovered ... .

Mathematical details (which can only make sense to a reader who is well versed in the arts of Number Theory) - requiring quite detailed
knowledge of <em>congruences</em>, <em>Fermat's 'little' theorem</em>, the <em>Euclidean Algoritmm</em>, etc. - may be accessed in
