continue to add to it from time to time...

<b>A note of April 2023</b>. I have not added to this page for over twenty years, and now I view it for the first time since I resigned my
Headship of St. Patrick's College Mathematics Department. <br><br>

One of the most dismaying things about trying to maintain a website is to discover broken web links, and immediately below I find that my two 
references to publications of the London Mathematical Society are amongst those:

<br>
<br>
In October 1998 I gave my incoming first year students (about 60 of them) a test. I
based it <em>rather loosely</em> on a similar test from a recent report of the London
Mathematical Society; specifically I based it (for the purposes of comparison) on <a
href = "http://www.lms.ac.uk/policy/tackling/node23.html#SECTION000191000000000000000">  <em>Appendix
A, New undergraduates</em>  </a> of the October 1995 LMS published report, <em>  <a
href = "http://www.lms.ac.uk/policy/tackling/report.html">Tackling the Mathematics Problem</a>  </em>.</p>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">I made my test a little more
demanding than the above, and you may <a href = "download/test_98.doc">download it here</a>. 
I have deleted most of the space between successive questions; in the printed form I allowed more space
for the students to do their work in.</p>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">

I also prepared a lengthy document to comment on their solutions, and to expand a little on the work related to the
test questions. You may <a href = "download/sol_oc98.doc">download that document here</a>. </p>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">In my initial contact with
first year students, one of the first things I try to get them thinking about is <em>numbers</em>,
and generally commence with a simple question like: </p>

<p align = "center" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">  <em>what is </em>the value
of the square root of 2?</p>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">I believe that a great deal
of serious mathematical work can flow from that <em>simple sounding</em> question (of
course one should not discuss a question like that out of context; one must give students
some inkling that that question has deep historical roots, going back to Pythagoras).</p>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">[I like to tell my students
an anecdote from my student days in London: once, while attending a postgraduate course on
<em>Anayltic Sets</em> - given by C.A. Rogers at University College - a group of us was
sitting with Rogers, having a chat, and someone asked him which mathematical question -
given a choice - he would most like to have resolved. After only a few seconds he replied:
<em>to know the decimal expansion of the square-root of 2 ... </em>]</p>

which I have prepared, which I only give out some time after class discussions.</p>
