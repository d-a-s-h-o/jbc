<b> A note of late March 2017. </b> 

 You may encounter a problem opening my Maple worksheets (as indeed I do myself) here at my web site - it would appear to depend on the internet 

browser being used. 

 Thus, if I attempt to open one of my worksheets using Interner Explorer there is never a problem, whereas if I use Firefox (or Google Chrome) then all 
that one sees - this is just an example - is something like this: 

   {VERSION 3 0 "IBM INTEL NT" "3.0" } {USTYLETAB {CSTYLE "Maple Input" -1 0 "Courier" 0 0 128 0 128 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "2D Math" -1 2 
"Times" 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "2D Comment" 2 18 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 } {CSTYLE "2D Output" 2 20 "" 0 0 0 128 0 1 0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE " " -1 256 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" -1 257 "" 0 1 0  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" -1 258 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0

and so on (almost at infinitum)... <br> 

<p> <b>I asked Maplesoft for advice on this</b> and they recommended doing the following (and I found it worked):

</p>

<ol>

<li> Don't attempt directly to open the worksheet (by clicking on my link), instead right click and save the worksheet to (say) the download folder.

</li> <br>

<li> Now that the worksheet is in the download folder (cut it out if you wish and put into whatever folder you wish) you may open the worksheet
     in the usual way (I should add that while I see this 'works', I have absolutely no idea as to why it does... ) [END OF NOTE].

</li> 

<br>

</ol>

</p>


<b> A note of 28th March 2017. </b> On Wed 8th of this month I gave a talk (<b>one which I dedicated to the memory of Jon Borwein (1951-2016)</b>) to the student Mathematics society at Trinity College Dublin. Some weeks beforehand I had provided the following description to give a flavour of my intentions for my talk: 

</p>

<b>Title</b>. The (remarkable and beautiful) binomial coefficient theorem of Gauss, and more besides.

</p>

<b>Abstract</b>. One of Gauss's most memorable and beautiful discoveries (with an extremely difficult proof) is his so-called 'binomial coefficient congruence' (it's a mod p congruence, prime p = 1 mod 4). One might think he had discovered it by doing ... , but a reading of his original Latin paper (1828, when he was 51) one sees he discovered it by a quite different approach. In any event, his original mod p theorem seemed a dead end until Karl Dilcher and I discovered the most general extended version of it (i.e., mod p^alpha, again for prime p = 1 mod 4, and all alpha = 2, 3, 4, ... ). What I would like to attempt is not just to state what this general extension, but rather show *how* this extension first occured to us, before we eventually made a proof of it. Not even the mod p^2 extension had ever been guessed. All of this can be described in quite simple language. " [END]

During the academic year 1995-96 I conceived the idea of having an annual <em>sponsored</em> public mathematics in my College, and I wrote innumerable 
letters to various companies seeking sponsorship. Since I had already lined up the eminent mathematician and cryptographer, 

<a href = "http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~fpiper/">Professor Fred Piper</a>, 

as our first speaker, I expected that my only problem would be that two sponsors would materialise at the same time, and that I would have to disappoint 
one of them (I was very naive... )  ...&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


(In January 2004, Fred Piper gave the annual Turing Lecture at the invitation of the 

<a href = "http://www1.bcs.org.uk/">British Computer Society</a>. 

On May 6<sup>th</sup> 2004 I gave a 

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/transcendental_numbers.htm">talk on transcendental numbers</a>, 


which I dedicated to Fred Piper - who taught me when I was an undergraduate at Royal Holloway College - marking his retirement.)In September 1996 an event
occurred which made me take the plunge and offer a public lecture myself: the announcement by Cray supercomputers of a new world record (which was broken 
shortly afterwards by George Woltman's 

<a href = "http://www.mersenne.org">GIMPS</a>). 

While I was at it I also decided to offer a public lecture linking prime numbers with cryptography. Those two lectures, and some others, are available 
below.</p> <br>

<p align = "left" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; margin-top: 0;">

In those far off days my college didn't have email or web facilities, but I did at home. It was from my home that I notified the Maple Users Group (which 
no longer exists) of my two initial lectures, and I offered the files to anyone who contacted me. I saved the early requests, and 

<a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/requests_for_Maple_files.pdf">here they are</a>

(a pdf file).

<br>

<br>


<strong>

Important note with regard to <em>html</em> versions of my lectures below

</strong>.

Maple, in converting active worksheets into html code, turns outputs (calculations, etc) into gif files, and so you may need to allow some time 
for downloading (at least years ago you did, but now - 2017 - perhaps not).&nbsp;
