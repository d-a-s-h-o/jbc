<p>I have created this small corner of my web site to give a small insight into
the warm, generous human side of a very great mathematician, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Struik.html">Dirk
Jan Struik (1894-2000)</a>.</p>
<p>Near the end of my second year as a schoolboy (1962-65) in Cowley, Oxford, I
read Dirk J. Struik's <i>A Concise History of Mathematics</i>. The version I
read could have been the original first edition of 1948; my own copy is the
Fourth Revised Edition of 1986-87.</p>
<p>At that time, 1964, Euler was something of a hero of mine, and, because DJ
Struik had written about Euler, I wrote to DJ Struik, using the address from his
book. In those days - as an innocent youth - I hadn't the remotest idea as to
what the MIT was, and was not deterred...</p>
<p>DJ Struik replied to me on one of those old fold-up airmail letters: <a href="download/Struik/letter1address.jpg">letter#1address</a>,
<a href="download/Struik/Letter1a.jpg">letter1a</a> and <a href="download/Struik/Letter1b.jpg">letter1b</a>.</p>
<p align="left">I must have been 'over the moon' to have heard from him, and I
responded. He replied as follows: <a href="download/Struik/letter2address.jpg">letter#2address</a>,
<a href="download/Struik/Letter2a.jpg">letter2a</a> and <a href="download/Struik/Letter2b.jpg">letter2b</a>.</p>
<p align="left">I further replied, and I heard from him yet again: <a href="download/Struik/postcard.jpg">postcard</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Despite what DJ Struik wrote at the end of his postcard, I never
wrote to him again, something which I very much regret. After all these years it is difficult to recall why I
didn't. It <i>could</i> be that I had picked up a sense that 'MIT' was a really
famous place and that I shouldn't be bothering such a famous person... I really
cannot say.</p>
<p align="left">But although that seemed to be the end of it, it wasn't. A very
wonderful moment for me was to meet Dirk Jan Struik himself, in the one hundreth
year of his life, and I quote the entire <a href="download/Struik/email_to_Ruth_Rebekka_Struik_14_Dec_2000.pdf">email</a>
that I sent to a daughter, the mathematician Ruth Rebekka Struik in December
2000, after I had heard of her father's death. I heard back RRS, and she did
want to have copies of her father's letters and postcard.</p>
