My <a href="Courses_3rd_year.htm"> third year Number Theory and Cryptography course</a> (there is a
<a href="Courses_2nd_year.htm"> preparatory
second year course on Number Theory</a>) - which I first taught in the academic year
1995-96 - is examined with a <b>3-hour written paper</b> (attempt six questions
out of eight, each question obtaining the same credit), and a <b>2-hour practical computer lab examination</b>
(all four questions to be attempted, the marks on the questions divided 30, 20,
30, 20) using <b>Maple</b>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Below I make available all my examination papers for the years from 1995-96 to
the present, 2001-2002. Not being LaTeX literate, I prepare my exam papers with
Microsoft Word, and a typical 3-hour paper would come to about 200-300KBs, and a
Rich Text Format (rtf) conversion would come to about 700-800KBs (the 2-hour
Maple papers would take up fewer KBs) Thus, to make my papers available, what I
have done is this: converted the Word versions to rtf, and then zipped those.<br>
<br>
Finally, I also make available one student's actual Maple work - question by
question - for the 1998-99 examination: I had to update it from its original
MapleV state to MapleVI, and I've also made a rtf conversion of it for readers
who may not have <b>Maple</b>. There was nothing particularly special about the
year or student that I choose (as it happens she was ranked in the middle of her
class of about thirty students). I have made her solutions available in two
formats: the original <b>Maple</b> mws format, and its rtf conversion.<br>
<br>
Starting a NT and cryptography course from scratch was problematic, especially
as I had absolutely no idea as to what anyone else was doing elsewhere. What
should I have in the course? How long would it take to cover the material? How
would one examine it? ... I would say that the first two years were exploratory
ones, and that it was only at the third attempt that I felt I really knew just
what I should have, and could cover, in my course.<br>
