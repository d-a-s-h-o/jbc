<p> The following photographs are mainly of family and friends. Where possible I have tried to place them in time and location; if in doubt I say so. 
       Initially - re family - I was concerned only with <i>my</i> family (Cosgraves and Flanagans on my father's side, and Sands(es) and Owens(es) on 
       my mother's side), but now I have begun to add something of my wife's family too (this could, of course, go on forever... ). <br><br>

      <b>Note of 5th April 2023</b>. When I first began a website - way back in 1999 - I never intended having a <i>photos</i> corner; rather I just
      intended inserting the occasional photograph. Of course, for mathematicians, I created my 
      <a href ="https://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/oxford.htm">Oxford 1969</a> page, a page, incidentally, that garnered over one thousand views within
       a month. <br><br>

        It was only with the passage of time that I created this <i>photos</i> corner as a subsection of my 
       <a href="https://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/biograph.htm">autobiography</a> page. Thanks to the remarkable 
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive<a> site I have been able to determine that the first appearance of this page looked like
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151217130451/staff.spd.dcu.ie/johnbcos/photos.htm">this</a> in December 2015 (only the actual
        text appears to be archived, but all the links to photos are broken). <br><br>

        Then, early in 2016, preparing for a visit to my sister Marie in San Francisco, I started for the first time to investigate my family background. 
        This was difficult to do, since my mother had died in 1967, my father in 1995, my brother Tony in 2009, and my brother Aidan in 2014, and I then
        had only two older sisters still living. But, bit by bit, I started to accumulate scant information (greatly aided by the wonderful <b>Sr. Mary de
        Lourdes Fahy</b>, of whom more below), and my genealogical discoveries began to be a feature of this page.

       <br><br>

<li>

    <a href="download/photographs/Laughile/Mary_Flanagan_death_9_Aug_1883_aged_77_Laughile.pdf"> Mary Flanagan</a> 
    (<b>1805/1806 - 9th August 1883</b>), a great-great-grandmother of mine. Caolan and Feidhlim: one day you will know this <i>Mary</i> to 
    be a great-great-great-great-grandmother of yours. All eight of my great-grandparents were born <i>before</i> the 

    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)">terrible famine</a> of the 1840/1850s. <br><br>

     Mary's husband - whose name I do not (yet) know - died before her; Mary's death - as you may read - was reported by a son of hers, '<i>Patt</i>', 
     presumably <b>Patrick</b> (below). <br><br>

     Without <i>this</i> Mary - and all the other fifteen - neither you (Feidhlim and Caolan) nor I would exist.

    <br><br> I have given an uncertain year for Mary's year of birth because if, for example, Mary was born in (say) December 1805, then she would 
    still have been <i>77</i> in August 1883. If I ever determine Mary's exact date of birth then I will alter the above. <br><br>

     Mary's son <b>Patrick, and his wife Maria</b> (n&eacutee Howard), were the parents of my grandmother <b>Catherine</b> (Monday 24th
     September 1860 - Tuesday 17th August 1915), my father's mother. I have written a great deal more about Catherine further down this page.

    <a href="download/photographs/final_photos/Dad_family_1911.jpg"> My father's family</a> 

   <b>1911</b>? (See photo #4 for Cosgrave/Cosgrove.) Dad's mother was <b>Catherine Flanagan</b>, from Laughil, about 5 miles south of Gort. 
         Dad used to tell that she was taught at school by 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cusack_(Gaelic_Athletic_Association)"> Michael Cusack</a>, 

and that she had once caused a stir at her school by refusing to accept a school prize from 

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Gough,_1st_Viscount_Gough"> Lord Gough</a> 

    because he had evicted her parents from their home on his land (I have to check this out sometime, for it could well have been her grandparents'
    home, rather than her parents'). On the left is my father's older brother Anthony, and anyone who knows my nephew - Danny McDonald - could not
   but be struck by the incredible likeness.

<br><br> 

   I only discovered recently that my grandmother lost an unnamed baby girl on Wednesday 15th February 1905; her death certificate gives her "Age last 
   Birthday" as being "1 hour". The girl's "Certified Cause of Death and Duration of Illness" is given as being "Premature Birth No med attend".

<br><br>

    Left to right: <b>Anthony</b> (b. 7 July 1902), <b>Catherine</b> (b. 24 Sept 1860), <b>Margaret</b> (b. 15 June 1899), <b>Michael</b> 
   (b. 6 Sept. 1863), <b>John</b> (b. 24 July 1906), <b>Bridget</b> (b. 31 Jan 1904).

<br><br>

    My eldest sister Marie (San Francisco, California) sent me the original of this scanned photograph in October 1993. Until then I had neven seen
    <i>any</i> photograph of the boy who was to become my father, nor any of his parents...

    <a href="download/photographs/final_photos/Patrick_Sands.jpg"> Patrick Sands (<b>1869-1913</b>)</a>, 

my mother's father. This is a copy of the original, given to me by my cousin Donal Sands (our grandfathers were brothers) when he visited myself 
and Mary in June 2016. Until then I had never seen a photograph of my grandfather. This was a very happy discovery for me. (Patrick was a very handsome man indeed; his photo is in front of me, on the bookshelves above my computer, as I do this work. I would so love to have a photograph of Annie, my mother's mother, but sadly I have to accept that I will probably never see one.)

<br><br> I see I wrote in that 1913 death certificate that "I couldn't find HIM [<b>John Owens</b>, Patrick's brother-in-law, who informed of Patrick's death] in <b>1911</b> census. And NO <i>Aghuigowly</i> anywhere." I now (April 2021) know why I couldn't find <i>Agh<u>ui</u>gowly</i>... ; it's because it was <i>Agh<u>in</u>gowly</i>... The Superintendant Registrar misled me with the misplaced dot... <br><br>

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/1911_Sands_census_returns.pdf"> <b>1911</b> census returns</a>.

<br><br> While my mother seems to have been named after <i>her</i> mother (I would like to think it an indication of Patrick's love of his wife), her brother and sister would appear to me to have been named after Patrick's own father and mother (see below).

<br><br>

My mother's mother - my grandmother Anne/Annie Owens/Sands - 

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/Annie_Sands_death_17_Jan_1918.pdf"> died</a> on the 17th of January 1918.

<br><br>

And here is page one of Annie's will, which she 

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/Annie_Sands_signature_on_will.jpg"> signed</a>

on "the 6th day of May nineteen hundred and fourteen", naming (two of) her brothers, Michael and Patrick, as her Executors.

<b>Some comments</b>. Re <i>Residence at the Time of Marriage</i>, what looks like (indeed <i>is</i> in the official document) <i>Rahorn</i> should be <i>Rahor<b>a</b>n</i>.

<br><br> <b>A very happy discovery of 7th April 2021</b>. I have just found 

<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.ie/article/list-of-teachers-employed-by-the-commissioners-of-national-education-on-31-march-1905/"> this wonderful site</a>, a compilation of the names of all <i>Teachers Employed by the Commissioners of National Education on 31 March 1905</i>, and, at page 10 of 

<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NAI_ED_PCO_10_1_31-SRooney-Rountree_Redux.pdf"> this sub-section</a>,
              
are the names of my mother's parents, her teachers at primary school: Annie (n&eacutee Owens) and Patrick Sands. Until I came upon this page I had not known the year of birth of my mother's mother - and I had wrongly thought it to be either 1865 or 1866 - but from this document (which shows that Annie Sands was 42 yrs and 6 months old in the month ending 31st March 1905) I deduce that she must have been born sometime in the month of September 1862. Unfortunately I have been unable to find her birth certificate.

<br><br> Patrick's parents were Daniel Sands (1831/32 - 1900), 

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/Daniel_Sands_1831_or_1832_to_1900.pdf">dying</a>

over four months before the birth of his grand-daughter, my mother Annie) and Susan Sands (<i>n&eacutee</i> Sloan). Here is great-grand-mother Susan in the

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/Susan_Sands_1901_census_returns.pdf"> 1901 census returns</a>, and she

<a href="download/photographs/Sands_Owens_births_etc/Susan_Sands_1833_or_1834_to_1913.pdf">died in 1913</a>, in the month following the 
   death of her son Patrick, my grand-father.

<br><br>

When I was a child growing up in Bailieboro there was a painting of my mother and her father which hung over the mantlepiece in the dining/sitting room of our home at Henry Street; my grandfather was seated, and my mother - wearing a white dress - stood at her father's right shoulder (how bitterly I regret now that I never asked my mother about it; I was young and lacking in curiosity...).

<br><br><b><i>Where is that painting now?</i> </b>After my mother's death in 1967 I became aware that the painting no longer hung where it had been, but it just didn't occur to me to ask my father what had become of it... I <i>think</i> I know what happened to it, but it is too late now to do anything about it.

    <a href="download/photographs/scans_March_2023/Aghintain_home_Mum_etc.jpg"> My mother's home and ... (<b>3 photos</b>)</a>. The     <b>top</b> photo (which I am unable to date) is one of the home (in Aghintaine, County Tyrone) of my maternal grandparents and their three children;      it was in my mother's possession when she died (May 1967). I recall visiting it once in the late 50s/early 60s, but to my regret I didn't have the      slighest interest in it at the time... <br><br>

     <a href="https://www.geograph.ie/photo/2847525">A photo</a> taken by <a href="https://www.geograph.ie/profile/2282">Kenneth Allen</a> in 2012       shows the recent state of that house, the no-longer-used Catholic church, and - on the opposite side of the road - the former Aghintaine National                School (it ceased to be used as a school in the early 1950s). My maternal grandparents taught in that school from the late 1890s, certainly until my
     grandfather died in September 1913. That school - where my mother and her siblings attended - opened in 1886, as evidenced by this 
     <a href="https://www.geograph.ie/photo/2847539">carved stone</a> set into a wall of the school. <br><br>   

     The <b>middle</b> (undated) photo shows (at the back) my mother Annie, with her brother Dan and sister Susan ('Susie'), but, given that Susie was
     born in 1903, it would be reasonable to date it to the mid 1920s. <br><br>

     The <b>lower</b> photo shows my mother (right) with an unidentified friend (?), undated. <br><br>

     My aunt Susie (a more fervent Catholic than the Pope) told me late in her life that her father - my grandfather - had built the original house with his      own hands on a plot of land given to him (on what understanding I cannot know) by the then parish priest, but that he had taken possession of it after         the death of her father (or was it after the later death of his wife, my grandmother; I cannot know). Then, in the late 2010s, I learned that the house      was up for sale, together with the ruined school opposite, and I contacted the selling agent in Enniskillen, explaining that I would want to buy the
     school 1886 plaque... Would they please contact the vendor/new owner to inform of my interest? Oh yes, they would... , but when I heard nothing I             contacted again, reminding of my earlier query, and eventually they put me in contact with the vendor. Unfortunately nothing came of my request,               though I did learn (is this true?) that the school could not be knocked down as it is now a 'protected building'...

<li>

    <a href="download/photographs/final_photos/Dad's_home_Gort_Cosgrove_over_shop.JPG"> Dad's home</a>.  

    Dad's father, Michael, owned a pub, which he bought with money he earned working on the Chicago-Pacific railway (one day I must look into the sailing records, to attempt determine when he sailed across the Atlantic, and when he returned, ... ). The pub is at 'Cosgrove', the third
    nameplate on the right hand side, Gort, County Galway). (The building is now a nail varnish salon, and its kind manager showed me inside during a recent visit). My grandfather was 'Cosgrove', but an <b>error</b> on my father's birth certificate led to him
    becoming 'Cosgrave'. I only found that out in late 1994, some months before my father died (when I asked my father about this - why didn't they rectify the error - he just said they didn't bother). But, had I not discovered that, then I would never have been able to locate his birthplace, ... 

<br><br>

<b>How I found out that I should have been CosgrOve, and not CosgrAve</b>. Sometime towards the end of 1994 I had a visit from a USA-born/based first cousin called <b>Harold</b> (his father and mine were brothers), and his wife Kathleen (she too had Irish family connections). I had only ever met this Harold once before, in the September of 1958, when, on a visit to Ireland, he visited my father (his uncle) in Bailieboro, my hometown. At that time I had just started to attend a boarding school - Gormanstown (a Franciscan establishment), and they - my mother and father, my brother Aidan, and Harold - came to visit me there. It must have been sometime in early September because I ran away from that school on three occasions, after roughly the third, fifth and sixth weeks, and then my parents removed me from that school. Harold's visit could hardly have been after my first abscondment?

<br><br>But now, back to late 1994... We had a lovely dinner here at our home, and just as they were leaving Harold asked me if I had ever visited the USA, and I told him I had been once - to the Centenary Meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Cincinnati earlier that year - and that I was about to go to San Francisco in January 1995 to attend its Winter Meeting there, and spend some time with my sister Marie before the meeting started... A conversation ensued:

<br><br> <b>Harold</b>. We have a son, <b>Christopher</b>, living there... you should meet up him if you can. <b>Me</b>. That would be great... <b>Harold</b>. I'll give you his address... (and here my great good fortune was that Harold didn't just write down an address, didn't just write <i>Christopher</i> followed by an address, but wrote out in full:  <i>Christopher Cosgr<b>o</b>ve</i>, followed by Christopher's address...). <b>Me</b>  (looking at it, and not just tucking it away). Harold, you've made a mistake here... you've written 'Cosgr<b>o</b>ve' when it should be 'Cosgr<b>a</b>ve'. <b>Harold</b>. No, we're Cosgroves, so you are too... <b>Me</b>. No, no, not at all... my father and your father are brothers, my father (and thus so am I) is a Cosgrave, so your father - and thus you - is also a Cosgrave... <b>Harold</b>. No, we have always been Cosgrove, so you must be Cosgrove as well... <b>Me</b>. I think that when Irish people emigrated to the States, landed at Ellis Island or wherever, they would have been asked their name etc, and sometimes errors were made... 

<br><br>We left it at that, and shortly afterwards I spoke to my father about this. That's how I learned about the error on my father's birth certificate... . I didn't get to meet Christopher in San Francisco, but we did meet up subsequently here in Dublin... , but we've lost contact. 

<br><br><b>Note of Monday 15th March 2021</b>. I have today discovered that my first cousin Harold died on the 28th of June 2018; there's a short obituary <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ctpost/obituary.aspx?n=harold-cosgrove&pid=189432111&fhid=4232"> here</a>. 

Where are Christopher... ? And Harold's sister <b>Irene</b>? I met Irene once: she was visiting my sister 'Kitty' (aka 'Kay', at birth 'Catherine') who was then living in Ballyjamesduff down in our County Cavan. They both came here to have lunch with us one day - oh how dearly I wish I had a photograph from the occasion - and we all remarked on how alike they looked; they could have been <i>sisters</i>. Isn't that extraordinary... this DNA business.

</li> <br>

<li>

    <a href = "download/photographs/scans_2021/Uncle_Tony_my_father_s_elder_brother.jpg">My uncle Tony</a> (<b>date unknown</b>), my father's      older brother. This photo was given to me by my sister Marie.

<br><br>

   My uncle Tony was born on the 7th of July 1902, and - in the light of what I wrote above at photo #4 (about Cosgr<b>O</b>ve - Cosgr<b>A</b>ve) - I    was amused to discover Tony's 

<a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Anthony_CosgrAve_7_July_1902.pdf">BIRTH registration</a>, which shows him as being a Cosgr<b>A</b>ve! On the other hand, his older sister Margaret has a 

<a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Margaret_CosgrOve_15 June_1899.pdf">BIRTH registration</a>, showing her as being a Cosgr<b>O</b>ve. And, it was the <i>very same</i> J. P. Moran who registered both of them!

<br><br>

   My uncle Tony emigrated to the USA sometime in the late 1910s / early 1920s (I must find out one day; see Addendum below), and he later offered 
   to pay my father's fare to also emigrate; happily Dad stayed here in Ireland. I only saw Tony once - it must have been in the mid/late 1950s when 
   he made a visit back to Ireland, and he came to Bailieboro to see Dad. I can clearly remember the two of them sitting unhappily together around 
   the table - Tony with a glass and bottle of whiskey, Dad not a drinker - and it was only in recent years (long after Dad died) that I could imagine the
   source of their obvious unhappiness: their mother (my grandmother Catherine Flanagan/McLoughlin/Cosgrove) took her own life on the 17th August 
   1915, and it was Tony (then only thirteen years and eight days old) who found her body (I have her death certificate, and an inquest report from the
   <i>Connacht Tribune</i>, dated 21st August 1915).

   <br><br>

   What secrets my father and his brother brought with them to their graves...

<br><br>

   Because my grandmother's taking of her own life was considered to be a '<i>mortal sin</i>' by the brutal and inhumane Catholic Church (with its
   perverted 'Theology'; yes, yes, "the Church eventually dropped the ban on funerals for suicides from its law code altogether in the 1980s", 
   touchy-feely has now become fashionable until some other theologian decides otherwise), she could not be buried in a Catholic cemetery, and I 
   have been unable to determine where she is buried.

<br><br>

   Before Catherine married my grandfather, she had been married to a James McLoughlin, whose own first wife Anne (n&eacutee Fahy) 

   <a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Anne_Fahy_McLoughlin_died_4_March_1890.pdf">died</a> 

    in Gort on the 4th of March 1890. 

    James and Anne had a son James, while James and Catherine had a daughter Mary, and then - yet another tragedy - my
   grandmother's husband James 

    <a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/James_McLoughlin_died_20_Sept_1895.pdf">died</a>

    in Gort on the 20th of September 1895. 

    <br><br> Mary (then aged 8) and her brother James (then aged 11) appear in the 

    <a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Cosgrove_1901_census.pdf">1901 census</a> of my father's parents, but not in the 1911
     census returns.

     <br><br>

      I would dearly love to know whatever became of Mary and James (I imagine that they emigrated, the common lot of so many Irish at that time).

<br><br>

   <b>Addendum and Tribute</b>. I owe a very great debt to a Gort-based nun, the scholarly <b>Sr. Mary DeLourdes Fahy</b> (author of 

   <a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Sr_Mary_DeLourdes_Fahy_book.jpg">this wonderful book</a>, <i>Education in the Diocese

    <a href = "download/photographs/Gort_related_photos/Cosgrove_from_DeLourdes_Fahy.rtf">this (rtf) document</a> (this will download, rather 
    than open). In particular I learned this small detail in relation to my uncle Tony: <br><br>

    "<i>Anthony Cosgrove, born circa 1902 [actually on 7th July 1902] emigrated to New York in 1923. It is stated in the emigration documents that 
      he was going to his 'aunt' Mrs. Jack Quinn.  She was really his stepmother's sister, Norah Dooley, who married  Jack Quinn of nearby Corker in
     1910, prior to their emigration. Mrs. Nora Quinn died in New York in 1951.</i>"

    My mother and a friend, Maureen McGowan</a>.  My mother's parents died in 1913 and 1918, and she and her brother and sister moved from the
    Clogher valley area of County Tyrone to live with an uncle (Mum's mother's brother) at 3 Howth Road, Clontarf, just down the road from where I am
    typing these words. I think - but cannot be certain - this photo was taken there. Was Mum about 19 in this photo? Mum trained as a teacher in the

    British left the students were split up... Mum transferred to Carysfort College in Blackrock, where I was later to work myself. Mum's father - who

    <b>Note added following the death of my sister Marie in California (9:20 PM local time, Tues. 15th Nov. 2023).</b> <br><br>

     I don't know when it first happened, but somehow my sister Marie started to be called <i>Mary</i> by people who knew her in California. I cannot
     bring myself to call her by any name other than <i>Marie</i>. <br><br>

    Of my four siblings - Marie (b. Wed. 13th Aug. 1930), Catherine/Kitty/Kay (b. 1931), Aidan (b. 1933) and Tony (b. 1934) - the <b>only one</b> of whom 
    I have an early photo is my sister Marie. Until recent years I had always supposed that Marie - like the rest of us - had been born in Bailieboro, 
    County Cavan (where our parents taught), but Marie herself surprised me by telling me that she had been born here in Dublin (in a small hospital 
    on Leeson Street, one which no longer exists, it's now an office block), the reason being that Mum's sister Susie - who was a nurse here in Dublin - 
    insisted that my mother have her first child born in a place that she presumably considered <i>safe</i>. The rest of us were born in Bailieboro, in 
    a house on Henry St. that my parents rented all their lives.

    <br><br>

     In <a href="download/photographs/Marie_big_sis/big_sis_Marie_4_photos.jpg">this compilation photo</a> I have four scans (the originals were 
     all <a href="download/photographs/Marie_big_sis/Marie_to_me_photos_Oct_1993.jpg">posted to me</a> by Marie in 1993). <br><br>

     The top two (dating from <b>early 1931</b>) in the compilation show my mother with baby Marie, and one with Marie on here own - these were
     almost certainly taken by my father's brother Tony (visiting from New York, for I have somewhere another mislaid photo of him with my mother 
     at the same time), while the lower two show my sister Marie in her (London) nurse's uniform (<b>late 1940s, early 1950s?</b>) - on the back of 
     that one is written in Marie's hand: <i>"With me is my dear friend Mae. Taken 6A.M. in the morning following a long night. Marie"</i>. The final 
     one shows Marie (on right) with her sister Kitty. <br><br>

     The above envelope shows that in October 1993 Marie was then living at #197, 21st Ave., San Fran., at a time when she worked at the nearby 

     <a href = "https://mountzion.ucsfmedicalcenter.org/">Mount Zion Medical Center</a>, and 

     <a href="download/photographs/Marie_big_sis/Marie_Mount_Zion_San_Francisco.jpg">this 2nd compilation</a> photo has written on the back:

     <i>"Some of the gals I worked with in Mt. Zion on my return from Saudi Arabia."</i> <br><br>

      Two friends of my sister - <b>Tina Ratto and Merilee Rossi</b> - have simultaneously identified everyone in that second compilation photo.
      They are, left to right, in the <br><br>

      <b>top</b> photo: Sandy Goldin, Tina Ratto, my sister Marie, Sandy Friedman and Taffy Dollard, <br><br>

      and left to right in the <br><br>

      <b>lower</b> photo: Jean Oliveira, my sister Marie, Tina Ratto, Mary Scheib, Sandy Friedman, Taffy Dollard, and Merilee Rossi.

     <br><br>

      Tina wrote: "<i>Merilee was with many friends at Marie's bedside when she died.</i>"

      <br><br>

     <b>Why</b> don't I have any other early photographs of Marie, or <i>any</i> of my other siblings? The most likely reason is the obvious one: 
      that was a time when hardly anyone could afford to own a camera, and my uncle Tony visiting from New York was probably a very exotic figure 
      having his own (or hired?) camera. In fact the earliest Cosgrave family photographs that I have - further down - date from the mid 1940s.

     The <b>top</b> photograph is from the wedding of Mary's parents (mid front row), Frank and Pat (n&eacutee McMahon) Smyth. <br><br>

     Frank's parents (2nd and 3rd from left, back row) were William and Bessie (n&eacutee Biscombe) Smith, and Pat's parents (2nd and 3rd from right,          back row) were Thomas and Bessie (n&eacutee Eastlake) McMahon. Pat's sister Rene is on her immediate left. <br><br>

     Mary's grandfathers were both Irish, William from Belfast and Thomas from Cork City. After the wretched Brexit outcome in Britain, Mary decided to       become an Irish citizen (she was already <i>Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis</i>, <i>more Irish than the Irish themselves</i>), and, while Mary could have       claimed Irish citizenship by virtue of being married to me, her route to citizenship was through her grandfather Thomas McMahon. <br><br>

     The two <b>lower</b> photographs are of Mary and Pat (probably late 1950s), and Pat.

<br><br>

Standing beside Susie is her husband Hugo McGovern, a good man, I liked him. Subsequently they lost a baby son, then had another, Pat(rick). Pat (my first cousin) and I were never close. <br><br>

There are four men standing in the back row; I'll identify those that I know, left to right. I don't know who is the first of them (though he could be Hugo's brother?). Second from the left is my Uncle Dan (the only brother of Susie and my mother); he was a travelling agent for the school books publishers Browne and Nolan. Next to Dan is Thomas Sands, a first cousin of my mother's, and a primary school teacher. <br><br>

Finally, on the very right, is my father, then just a month shy of his thirty-fifth birthday. <br><br>

I don't know the woman immediately to Susie's left, but I do know the woman immediately behind <i>that</i> woman: my mother Annie, then just two months shy of her forty-first birthday. <br><br>

In her nineties, Susie gave me a precious document: a four page letter that my mother wrote to her weeks before she died in May 1967. I've scanned those pages:

        I visited the United States for the first time in <b>January 1994</b>, when I ventured to Cincinnati to attend the Centenary Meeting of the

<li> After we escaped from Nigeria (late November 1975) I started a new job in Carysfort College, Blackrock, Co. Dublin on the 12th of January 1976.             There I (and my wife also) made a wonderful friend: <b>Proinsias N&iacute Dhorcha&iacute</b> in the Irish Department.

       <br><br>

       Growing up in Bailieboro - and in the years following until I returned to Ireland at the age of thirty - I had never heard any <i>real</i> traditional 
       Irish music, and it was a revelation to me to discover the music of the renowned uileann piper

       <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9amus_Ennis"> S&eacuteamus Ennis</a>. And yet another pathway to discovery was the 
        wonderful RT&Eacute radio programme <i>An Droichead Beo</i> (The Living Bridge), presented by <b>Peadar Mercier</b> (oh, if only
        RT&Eacute would repeat it...).

      <br><br> 

       Then - oh joy of joys - through Proinsias we became friends of Peadar, and then later friends of <b>Nuala</b>, Peadar's wife.

       Proinsias was a wonderful flute and tin whistle player, and as there were many talented traditional music players in the student body at Carysfort,
       Mary and I used to invite some of them (with Proinsias and Peadar) to play their instruments here at our home (I care to recall Peter McCabe, 
       Mary Jo Brennan, Maedbbh N&iacute Lochlainn, Mary and Collette McKenna, and Br&iacuted Coffey).

       <br><br> Through Peadar's friendship with the renowned <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_MacMahon"> Tony MacMahon</a> we
       once enjoyed a memorable evening when Tony played here (he gave a rendering of <i>Aisling Gheal</i> (Bright Dream), and there wasn't a dry eye 
       in the house...)

      <br><br>

       S&eacuteamus Ennis was to have played here on another evening, but, when Proinsias went to collect him, he had just gone into hospital, and the
       opportunity never came again.

      <a href = "download/photographs/Rajasthani_Baul/Manmohan_Thakore_Dublin_22_Feb_1985.jpg">Manmohan Thakore</a>, Dublin, 
      <b>22nd February 1985</b>. I met Manmohan here in Dublin over a period of two days, Friday 22nd and Saturday 23rd of February 1985, and 
      subsequently we enjoyed a lovely friendship-at-a-distance: at least sixteen letters - I still have his sixteen to me - each way between Kolkata/Beijing 
      and Dublin, from March 1985 to shortly before Manmohan's death in 1992. Manmohan's last letter to me is dated 4th March 1992. <br><br>

      In his fifth letter, written on 1st February 1986, just back from a two week holiday in N.E. India, Manmohan commented on my letter of 8th January 
      which he had just seen, and then continued: "...<i>But then came the biggest shock of all when the T.V. announced the death of Nikhil. He has been
      cremated only last evening. Each one of us feels it as a personal loss. The route to the cremation Ghat was lined with six portraits of the dear 
      departed and the procession took full two hours to reach the Ghat. All the local artistes, including my friend, Ustad Imrat Khan, were there to lay 
      wreaths and pay homage. What a tragedy!</i>" <br><br>

      How did I come to know Manmohan? It's all to do with my falling in love with the traditional and classical music of India, a love affair that
     <i>tentatively</i> began at Easter 1966 (when I came to know of Ravi Shankar on an LP of Yehudi Menuhin's, one brought out to mark Menuhin's 
      50th birthday), lay dormant for some fifteen years, but rekindled in early 1981 (when I saw

     <a href="http://www.alarmelvalli.org/">Alarmel Valli</a> in a BBC TV series called <i>The Spirit of Asia</i>). In April that year I visited Blackwell's
      music section in Oxford and just blindly bought every single Indian record they had... One of those was a truly wonderful recording of Rajasthani 
     traditional music - Songs of Love and Devotion of Rajasthan (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3SlSlmuMMA">here it is!</a>). 

     <br><br>

      In the following months I came to know of the Baul traditions in Bengal - I bought some recordings - and then, at the end of January 1985, a chance
      accident led to the <a href = "https://www.iccr.gov.in/home">Indian Council for Cultural Relations</a> sending a delegation of both Rajasthani 
     (Langas and Manghaniyars) and Baul musicians to visit Dublin... Why a 'chance' accident? Well, this is what happened. For over a year I had been 
     on friendly terms with Kiran Doshi (the then Indian Ambassador) and his wife Razia, and at the end of 1984 they went to India for the Christmas/new
      Year period. On her return Razia phoned to tell me that in their absence a telegram had arrived from the I.C.C.R. asking if there would be any Irish
      interest in such a visit, but - while they were away - an embassy official had responded negatively... Razia asked if I knew anything about such music, 
     did I think there would be any interest? <i>Of course there would be interest!! <b>I</b> would be more than interested!!</i> <br><br>

      Razia contacted the I.C.C.R. to cancel the original negative response, and the upshot was than on Friday the 22nd of February 1985 this truly
      wonderful mixed group arrived here in Dublin, the Baul group managed by (my soon-to-be-friend) Manmohan, the Rajasthani group managed by
      Komal Kothari (I had LPs on which he had contributed the sleeve notes). <br><br>

      Kiran did me the honour of asking me to meet them at the airport on his behalf (as soon as I set eyes on them I could <i>see</i> they were <i>the 
     genuine article</i>), and to bring them directly to the Embassy for a meal. Entering the Embassy the musicians attempted to touch Kiran's feet (the 
      traditional way of showing respect), but Kiran would have none of it. They didn't head straight for food, but instead sat on the floor and sang song 
      after song... it was simply heavenly... Later I phoned a few friends to say: <i>you have to attend their concert in Trinity College tomorrow night or 
      you will regret it for the rest of your lives...</i> <br><br>

      Later that evening they gave an invitation (various ambassadors and students) only performance in the Royal Irish Academy of Music (R.I.A.M.) ... 
      it was poorly attended but they sang as if doing so for the entire world. I don't recall seeing a single student... Afterwards the musicians and myself
      headed for the home of one of the embassy staff and once again they sat on the floor and just sang their hearts out (<i>could I have been dreaming 
      all of this?</i>), and I made my way home in the early hours of Saturday morning, punch drunk on music. <br><br>

      The following morning I phoned our friend Peadar Mercier (see elsewhere on this page): <i>Peadar, believe me, tonight some of the most 
      remarkable musicians you will ever hear are performing in Trinity College, you must be there, tell everyone you know... </i> <br><br>

      I spent most of that day with them - there was a capacity audience (some 300-400), what an occasion! - afterwards Kiran told me he had invited the 
      musicians back to his residence, and to bring with me whomever I wished... I found Peadar and he went up with me. Before I proceed let me just
      record this observation of Peadar's: that at that time, Manmohan was <i>the</i> best presenter he had seen in his lifetime (and Peadar would have
      seen some quality over the years... ; what a very great pity, though, that Peadar - who died 6th September 1991 - did not live to see his own son Mel 
      present his U.C.C. Gamelan orchestra, for then Peadar would have placed Mel on that same pedestal). <br><br>

      A photo that I <i>wish</i> I had been able to take: still at TCD - before heading up to Kiran's - I was with Peadar when one of the Baul
      musicians stood with us, one who had a beard just like Peadar's. Having no common language, but admiring each other's beards, each touched and
      stroked the other's, a delightful moment. The following afternoon I took a photograph of that Baul, and 

     <a href = "download/photographs/Rajasthani_Baul/Baul_beard_Peadar.jpg">here it is</a>. And - for the record - here's a 

      <a href = "download/photographs/Rajasthani_Baul/Komal_Kothari_and_Rajasthani.jpg">photo</a>

       of (the renowned) Komal Kothari with one of the Rajasthani musicians, and one of the remarkable

        Bundu Nek Muhamad Khan (I am relying on a note I made at the time, having asked Komal Kothari), and finally a

        Rajastani musicians, all these from the afternoon of Saturday 23rd February 1985. A memorable time in my life. <br><br>

     visiting Bombay/Mumbai and while there - and keeping it a secret from me - they got a tailor to fashion an Indian outfit for me... <br><br>

        I surprised Paul one day by calling on him dressed up in my Indian finery (the silk scarf I was wearing was a gift to Mary from another Indian friend). 
       Our daughters had said to me <i>Dad, don't you dare wear that out of the house, our friends will laugh... </i>, what else could I do but give their

<li> In July 1999 I was the fortuitous discoverer of the (then) largest known composite Fermat number (in mathematical notation it was the number

       <i>F</i><sub>382447</sub> = 2<sup>(2<sup>382447</sup>)</sup> + 1, a number so large, that it could not be written out in the entire universe); 
       I wrote extensively about it <a href = "https://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/fermat.htm">here</a>. <br><br>

       The <i>real</i> credit for this discovery goes to Yves Gallot, the remarkable French engineer/mathematician who wrote the Proth software which
       made it possible. The enlightened French Embassy in Dublin invited Yves and his wife Lucile to spend four days here, and my wife and I arranged 
       a party here at our home to celebrate their visit. <br><br>

       upon a <i>Rue Fermat</i> (I cannot find a photo of me standing under the street sign bearing his name), and recall having a coffee in a cafe on it. 
       To my dismay, when I asked the staff if they knew anything about Fermat, I just drew a blank (but then, I daresay, if I asked most people on 
       O'Connell Street if they knew who (the great) Jim Larkin was, I might also get blank stares).

<li> When our friend Mel was a member of the Music Department in University College Cork (first as a lecturer, then Professor and Head of Dept.) 
        his third year specialist students used to give an annual Gamelan performance. For a number of years Mary and I, and Nuala (with other Merciers)

     We visited Portugal for the first time in <b>September 2013</b>, staying for four/five nights in each of Lisbon, Sisimbra and Ericeira. From Lisbon 
      we made a day trip to Sintra (a delightful train journey) and walked to the top of the local hilltop, en route passing a house in which Hans Christian 
      Andersen

      <a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/Sintra_Hans_Christian_Andersen.jpg">had lived</a>

      for a while. <br><br>

      Returning to Sintra from our hilltop walk we fell into the wonderful Fabrica das Verdadeiras Queijadas da Sapa; here is 

      <a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/Sintra_cafe_Mary.jpg">Mary</a> in its lovely cafe, which - at the time - we had entirely to ourselves.

      she completely understood why I said it. (On our second visit to Portugal I was delighted that my <i>Eu gostaria de uma fatia de bolo de chocolate,

     <b>17th September 2015</b>. In 2015, Royal Holloway organised a fifty year reunion for students who went up there in October 1965 (the

During the year 1965-1966 a new extension to Kingswood (the men's Hall of Residence) was being built,       and it opened in time for use in September 1966. The Hall was divided up into little pockets of eight rooms, and those of us in this photograph (all 
      mathematicians) occupied one of those corridors (we were <i>the Maths corridor</i>). <br><br>

     When Mary went up to Royal Holloway in January 1965 to be interviewed by members of the French Department (and also by some member 
     of the College's Administration), she sat outside the interview room waiting to be called, when out the door burst Lesley who declared (so Mary tells        me): "<i>I never want to set foot in this place ever again</i>" (but of course she did!). 

     <br><br>            

     Later that year, in September, when Mary was taking the train from Plymouth up to Reading to catch another train directly to Royal Holloway,
     she found herself in a carriage with (the previously unknown to her) Anna - who had journeyed from Oxford - also heading for Royal Holloway.

    In March 2016 Mary and I stayed at the Lady Gregory hotel in Gort (my father's hometown), principally so that I could discover what I could of my
    grandmother's homeplace, knowing only that she hailed from Laughile, and had attended Lough Cutra school (entering there in January 1867, when          Michael Cusack was the school principal). Helpful staff there had put me in touch with a wonderful local farmer - Colm Flanagan - whose children
    attended the modern school, and - miracle of miracles! - who farmed in the <i>very location</i> where my grandmother's parents had also farmed. 
    (How dearly I would love that Colm and I be cousins...)

     (for which they paid rent to an English landlord, Lord Gough) - it was just to the right of the gate in this photograph. There is now a 
     modern bungalow standing on the original site (I couldn't bear to take a photograph of it). <br><br>

     Knowing the locality intimately, Colm was strongly of the view that in order to get to her school by the shortest path (by far), my grandmother 
     Catherine would have walked the path through that gate... (How often in my imagination have I trod that path...)

   Myself and <a href = "download/photographs/John_Erhard_Noto_28_Sept_2017.jpg">Erhard Gl&oumltzl</a>, in Noto (Sicily), <b>Thursday 28th

<br><br>

    Mary and I stayed on the beautiful, historic (Greek/Roman) island of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortygia">Ortigia</a> for eleven nights, 
    apart from one night in the middle which we spent in another nearby historic town, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto">Noto</a>. <br><br>

    At breakfast, in the garden, in our lovely B+B, the proprietor Pepe (whom everyone in the locality seemed to know, for we later saw him wandering
    around and he was greeted by everyone who passed by) introduced us to another couple sitting at a nearby table: Erhard and his lovely wife Dagmar.

    <br><br> I don't know how it happened, but very quickly Erhard and I established that we were both mathematicians, and Erhard wanted to know
    something of the kind of work that I did... <b>From my diary of that day</b>: "<i>E. asked me to tell him... I explained</i> [on paper] <i>Wilson, 
    Gauss, Lagrange, Gauss's 1828 binomial coefficient congruence and OURS.</i>" ['OURS' being the vast, and ultimate generalization of it that 
    Karl Dilcher and I gave in 2009/2010, which is part of our second paper <a href = "https://johnbcosgrave.com/publications">here</a>.]

    <br><br>

     After about an hour of this we looked up - hearing our wives laughing at us - laughing at two mathematicians lost in their world, and it was then
     that the above photograph was taken... I think it captured our happiness at having shared a moment in time.

     <br><br>

     By pure chance Mary and I met them again the following evening: we were back in Ortigia, sitting outside a restaurant, when Erhard and Dagmar 
     passed by, on their way to a reserved table at another place... (And the following day I was rescued in the sea - a sea in which I liked to imagine
     the great Archimedes himself had swum (for he had lived in adjacent Syracuse) - by Kathy Tidey, who had trained with the Canadian swimming team. 
     Kathy is in my phone contacts as '<i>Kathy who saved me</i>', and we keep in touch.

    (Incidentally, one morning, in a bakery in Ortigia where I used to buy our morning bread, an elderly local man - whom I had never met before - said
     something beautiful to me: "<i>grazie per amare la nostra Ortigia</i>",  thank you for loving our Ortigia - to which I replied (I had just enough Italian
    to understand him, and to respond) - <i>&eacute molto semplice a essere in amorato con Ortigia</i>, it's very easy to be in love with Ortigia. How I
    wish I had even a fraction of my wife's Italian, she who was once asked by two women <i>Algherese</i> (a regional dialect of Italian, with
    Catalan elements) speakers in Alghero (Sardinia) if she was from Rome. <br><br>

    One day in Ortigia we got into conversation with an American couple; they were doing the usual million-miles-an-hour Europe visit: ... , one day in
    Ortigia, then flying out to Palermo for one night there, thence to Paris for one night, ... . The lady asked me for how long would we be in Ortigia, and, 
    when I said <i>eleven days</i>, she looked horrified and asked in an incredulously voice '<i>why?!</i>' When I remarked that eleven days was not 
    long enough, not even eleven weeks, nor even eleven months... she looked at me as if I was truly insane.)

    <a href = "download/photographs/Marie_big_sis/Marie_17_March_2023.jpeg">My sister Marie</a>, looking happy on her final St. Patrick's Day, 
    <b>17th March 2023</b>, 'final' because she died - peacefully - according to Maria Flores (her wonderful carer) at 9:20 PM <b>local California 
     time</b> on Wednesday 15th November 2023. <br><br>

     Further up this page is a photograph of myself and my four siblings, one taken on the day of our father's funeral (Sunday, 20th March 1995). Shortly 
     after that date my sister Marie made this prediction: <i><b>Tony</b> (b. 1934, died in London onTuesday 15 Sept 2009) will be the first of us to 
     die, then <b>Aidan</b> (b.1933, died in London on Wednesday 21 May 2014), then <b>Kay</b> (b. 1931, died in Virginia, County Cavan, on 
     Tuesday 3 March 2020), then <b>Marie</b> herself (Marie, b. 1930, died in Mill Valley, California, on Wednesday (California time) 15 November
     2023), then finally you (b. 1946)</i>. Marie proved to be right.
