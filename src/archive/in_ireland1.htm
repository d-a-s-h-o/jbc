<p>The worst web site in Ireland must surely be that of our Government's <a
href="http://www.irlgov.ie/educ/default.htm">Department of Education and Science</a>
(worst, given its avowed aim to have all citizens be web literate etc, and given its
resources...). Its <a href="http://www.irlgov.ie/educ/organisation/213e33a.htm"><b>Contact
Addresses and Numbers</b></a> corner is - in my view - utterly useless, since it names not
a single official, nor gives any email addresses... <em>Who</em>, for example, is the
Chief Inspector for Mathematics? One <em>might</em> wish to write to him/her...</p>

<p>(Once I <em>did</em> want to write to the Chief Inspector for Mathematics, and was
reduced to phoning the department to find out his/her name. I was given <em>a</em> name,
and wrote to him about an important matter. Five weeks passed without an acknowledgement
(one is not surprised by that, but at the same time...), and I foolishly wrote again: when
might I expect to hear ... ? The recipient wrote to tell me that <em>he</em> was not the
Chief Inspector for Mathematics; rather it was someone else. The someone else had been in
receipt of my letter... but just hadn't bothered to reply to me...)</p>

<p>Even if one goes to <a href="http://www.irlgov.ie/educ/organisation/neworg.htm"><strong><em>The
Management of the Department</em></strong></a> section, one finds not a single contact
detail (phone, fax, email). </p>

<p>I have been writing to persons in that department (including its Secretary-General) on
and off about this matter since April 1996 (when it launched its web site), but no one
there appears to give a toss. When its site was first launched the then minister invited
the site's &quot;customers&quot; (ugh!) to comment on it, and I wrote that unless it
hugely improved the content, it would soon cease to have any customers. By way of a
standard for it to aim for I suggested it seek out the (then) worst known site in the
world and aim that high; then it might be getting somewhere. Now, over four years later,
it hasn't even reached that high.</p>
