In one corner of my this old website (<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/fermat6.htm">Fermat6</a>)

is an unpublished paper of mine, 'Could there exist a sixth Fermat prime? I believe it is <i>not impossible</i>.'

At the top of that paper I wrote:

</p>

<p align = "center" class = "style3" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">

<i>

For my wife, Mary, and in memory of my parents Annie Sands (1900-1967) and Se&aacuten Cosgrave (1906-1995)

</i> 

</p>

<p align = "left" class = "style3" style = "margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">

and now, as I make my final additions (at the time of original writing, August 2007) to my site, I repeat that same dedication.

<br><br>

At the time that I wrote the above '<i>final additions</i>' I wrongly thought that this page (and all the others too) had indeed reached its final form (leaving St. Patrick's College I believed I would never again be able to edit my website...). But, through the later help of a son-in-law (<b>Fiachra Lennon</b>), and - more recently - a brilliant young DCU student (and near neighbour) <b>Alex Killalea</b> (who now hosts my site), I am able to update material. Thank you Fiachra and Alex; I could not have done it without your help.

Here is a <a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/Mum_MrsMurray_Anne_McDonagh_Dad_et_all.jpg"> photograph</a>

with my parents in it (from the left: Mum, Mrs Murray, Anne McDonagh, Dad, and Ciar&aacuten Maguire 

(an uncle of the renowned Irish chef <a href="https://www.nevenmaguire.com/">Neven Maguire</a>) at their school in Bailieboro, taken in 
the early 1960s; and here is one of 

<a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/Mum's_garden_Bailieboro.jpg"> my mother's garden</a> 

- a beautiful place - at the back of our home in Henry Street, Bailieboro. Dad did some gardening - always in a suit - but it was 

<i> Mum's garden</i>. 

I used to love climbing those trees at the bottom of the garden. Once, when I was perhaps ten years old, with a nearby tree (which I later tried
to paint, in London, when I was a student there), I turned my back on it, and wondered if it was still there... I tried turning quickly to see if 
I would find that it had gone away... Many years later I read somewhere - in Bertrand Russell? - that others had done that over the years. And here is 

<a href = "download/photographs/final_photos/my_tree.JPG"> that tree</a>, in a photograph I took recently.

A <i>truly remarkable</i> internet discovery for me was finding the <a href = "https://archive.org/"><b>Internet Archive</a></b> (also known as <b>The Wayback Machine</b>). Visit there to see how it works. 

<br> <br> Here's how I've used it: my first website had this address: <b>www.spd.dcu.ie/johnbcos</b>, but that was later changed to <b>staff.spd.dcu.ie/johnbcos</b>. The latter ceased to exist sometime in July 2016. But - and this is the wonder of the Internet Archive - I can now see saved versions of all my early web pages by going to the Internet Archive site, enter either of the above addresses, and see ... . Try it!! 

<br> <br>

<b>By way of example</b>, I find at the Internet Archive site that the <b>first</b> recorded image of my original website is

<a href = "https://web.archive.org/web/20010520121919/http://www.spd.dcu.ie:80/johnbcos/">here</a>, at the foot of which page is stated " This page was last updated 16 February 2001 12:53:01 -0000 ", and the <b>final</b> recorded image (dated at 20 July 2016) is

A fiftieth anniversary edition of Constance Reid's <b>FROM ZERO TO INFINITY</b> was published in January 2006 (there is a delightful Notices of the American Mathematical Society review by  

<a href = "https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~reznick/"> Bruce Reznick</a>

 <a href = "https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~reznick/rev-reznick.pdf"> here</a>).

I was absolutely delighted that Constance Reid quoted from a September 1999 email of mine in her two new pages 'What mathematicians and
teachers write about <b>FROM ZERO TO INFINITY</b>.' That 1999 initial contact with Constance Reid resulted from an 

<a href="http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind9908&amp;L=NMBRTHRY&amp;P=R885&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3">August 1999 email</a> 

that I sent to the Number Theory Mailing List. To see what Constance quoted you will have to buy her wonderful book, the book that determined 
the course of my mathematical life. I shall always treasure the 

<a href="download/CReid/signed_copy.jpg">signed copy</a> 

of the 50th anniversary edition which Constance sent to me. 

(Here is the cover of 

<a href="download/CReid/FROM_ZERO_TO_INFINITY_1959_COVER.jpg">

my 1959 copy</a>.)

In 2017 I was invited by photographer <a href="https://www.patrickbolger.com/"> Patrick Bolger</a> (on the recommendation of

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Robinson_(cartographer)/"> Tim Robinson</a>) to be photographed for a future collection of his, and to contribute - for inclusion in the collection - some work of mine in my handwriting. I saw it as <b>an opportunity to repay a personal debt to Constance Reid</b>. 

<br><br>

My contribution (because Constance had used the term <i>discoveries</i> I decided to also use <i>Discovery One, Two, ...</i>, but, for mathematicians reading this, they should replace <i>Discovery</i> with <i>Theorem</i>):

A painting by Leeds based artist Tom Marine of the 2000-digit prime was purchased by Turlough Sheehan (Director of Consolidated Distributions Services Ltd.), knowing that Tom would divide the entire amount between the NSPCC (UK) and the Irish Cancer Society. I gave the background to that sale in An Irishman's Diary column (written by me), published by the

<b> A note of Thursday 25th February 2021. </b> Today, rooting through an old box of this-and-that I came upon a lovely find: the two page note that Tim had made for his introduction at Kenny's Bookshop at our launch, and here they are:

<b> A note of Monday 23rd January 2023. </b> I dedicated this little booklet to two friends (Proinsias N&iacute Dhorcha&iacute and Maura Ward, who died within three days of each other, on the 16th and 19th of July 1994) whom I had known from my time in Carysfort College. When I received early copies from Tim Robinson in December 1999 I gave a signed copy to another dear friend - Aideen McMahon - with whom I had also worked in Carysfort, and then, following its closure, in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra).

<br><br>

From my diary of of 8th Dec. 1999: "<i>Phoned Aideen and was with her for about three hours</i>", and on 24th Dec. "<i>I cycled out to Aideen to give her a pot of my millennium jam: loganberry, raspberry, gooseberry and rhubarb</i>".

<br><br>

Aideen died on the 24th of the following month, January 2000. Had Aideen died before my booklet went to print I would have included her in my dedication. Later her sister Nessa came upon the signed copy I had given to Aideen, and years later Nessa created this beautiful <i>prime number quilt</i> (which she most generously gave to me as a gift), and wrote an article about it in the Winter 2017 issue of the Journal of the Irish Patchwork Society:
