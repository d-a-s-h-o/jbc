<p align="left">I have created this small corner of my web site to give a small
insight into the warm, generous human side of a very great mathematician, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halmos.html">Paul
Richard Halmos</a> (1916-2006).</p>
<p>On reading Stan Wagon's November 1992 MAA <i>Monthly</i> review of Paul
Halmos' <i>Problems for Mathematicians Young and Old</i>, I wrote a short paper
entitled <i>A Halmos Problem and a Related Problem</i>; my paper was published
in the Monthly, Vol. 101, No. 10, December 1994.</p>
<p>Before it was accepted for publication I sent a copy of it to Paul Halmos
himself, hoping he might find it of passing interest.</p>
<p>To my very great delight he wrote a very generous <a href="download/Halmos/Halmos%20Problem%20letter.jpg">letter</a>
to me, and sent me a <a href="download/Halmos/Halmos%20signed%20copy.jpg">signed copy</a>
of his reviewed book (something to treasure).</p>
<p>Subsequently, after my inaugural DCU Talented Youth work, I sent PR Halmos a
copy of the substantial document that may be found in the <a href="talented.htm">Talented
Youth</a> corner of my web site; he responded with a most generous <a href="download/Halmos/Talented%20Youth%20letter.jpg">letter</a>.</p>
<p>I met Paul Halmos just once, at the January 1995 Winter Meeting of the AMS/MAA
in San Francisco. I was in one of the large lecture theatres, where hundreds of
people were waiting for a talk to begin, and I was looking around to see if I
could spot a friend of mine, <a href="http://www.math.byu.edu/~baker/"> Roger
Baker</a>. Turning around, I bumped into Paul Halmos,
and I blurted out something like: <i>oh, Professor Halmos</i>... Examining my name tag to see who
I might be, he said: <i>ah, my Irish correspondent</i>. He pulled out his
camera, stepped back, and said: <i>I must have a photo of you</i>.</p>
<p>It was very amusing for me, for I could see that people round about knew who
the photographer was, but they wouldn't have had the remotest idea as to who I was. Clearly,
though, I must have had something going for me to have Paul Halmos want to take my
photo...</p>
<p>The lecture was just about to begin, and we all sat down, and I didn't get to
see my friend Roger until after the talk was over. Then, Roger and I were standing
outside chatting, and, by chance, Paul Halmos came over to us. Not knowing if they knew
each other I introduced them, and Roger said to PRH that he had met him the
previous year when he - PRH - had visited Roger's university (BYU) to give a
talk. However, as it happened, PRH had no memory whatever of their meeting...</p>
<p>After PRH had drifted away I seized my opportunity to have a bit of fun
(which may, perhaps, only be appreciated by people who know that Roger is a very
great mathematician indeed, existing at a much higher level of activity that
yours truly) at my friend's expense. I said something like this: <i>you know
Roger, you think (indeed you are) a very famous guy, but not quite as famous as
your old friend, John here. You know, PRH took my photo earlier, but he didn't
do the same with you. I am a somebody, while you are a complete nobody.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">In the years following, I took to sending PRH email greetings on
his birthday, 3rd March. I usually signed myself as the Secretary of his Irish Fan Club, once
or twice sending a message like this: ('with apologies to [the irish poet]
Patrick Kavanagh')&nbsp; <i>Halmos X years old today, what is there one can say?
On the day that he was one, there were apples in the sun, Halmos X years old
today, and there's nothing more to say</i>.</p>
<p align="left">He usually responded that it was nice to be remembered...</p>
<p align="left">In 2001 - after I had introduced my <a href="http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/challenging.htm">Challenging
Mathematical Puzzles and Problems course</a> - <a href="download/Halmos/PRH_birthday_2March2001.pdf">I
wrote</a> to Paul Halmos to tell him of the photo birthday greetings that you
may see at the top of the above web corner. Here is his <a href="download/Halmos/RE%20Thank%20you.txt">response
on that occasion</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Some months ago the MAA wrote to its members asking for those
who would like to purchase a brick on the Paul R. Halmos Commemorative Walk, and
I was <a href="download/Halmos/MAA_Brick_Paul_Halmos.eml">very happy to do so.</a></p>
