My paper - <i>An Introduction to Number Theory with Talented Youth</i> - was accepted for publication in a special edition of the 

<a href = "https://www.ssma.org/school-science-and-mathematics-journal"><i>School Science and Mathematics Journal</i></a>

(USA) on gifted and talented mathematics and science students. The paper was published in the Volume 99, Number 6, October 1999, edition of School Science and Mathematics (pages 348-353). 

<br> <br>

This paper is a much abbreviated version of a substantial document (54 pages) with the same title, which describes some of the work  that I did with a group of sixteen students in July 1993 in the 

<a href = "https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/index.shtml">Irish Centre for Talented Youth</a> 

at 

<a href = "https://www.dcu.ie">Dublin City University</a> 

in its first year of operation.

<br> <br>

My entire emphasis was on trying to get students to <i><b>think</b></i> about serious mathematical questions. I believe I succeeded ... . See for yourself, and let me know what you think (Over the years I have heard from only one person: Dr. Charalampos Toumasis, Director of the Patras State Department of Education (Greece); as Gauss said in another context: <i>few, but great</i>).

The entire test of the original 54-page document (which has my now out-of-date email address, and old web site address) is now 

<a href = "download/Talented%20Youth/NT_talented_youth.pdf">available here</a> 

in pfd format. Anyone who wishes to write to me about this document should use my email address at the foot of this page.

I greatly value <a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/halmos1.htm">Paul Halmos' opinion</a> 

of the above document.

<br> <br> The following year I was invited to teach for a second time on the programme, and I happily accepted. On that occasion, having just decided to teach a new course (<a href = "https://www.johnbcosgrave.com/archive/Courses_3rd_year.htm">Number Theory and Cryptography</a>) to my undergraduate students, I thought it an ideal opportunity to test out the basic ideas of my course with my young students... A bit of a risk, yes, but it worked. They learned a lot of new Number Theory, quite different from what they had encountered the previous year (several came for a second time).

<br><br> When I was about mid-way through what I intended doing I was approached by the (then) head of the Mathematics Department 

<a href = "https://www.dcu.ie/maths/people/alastair-wood">Alistair Wood</a> (oh dear, not much there...) who asked if I would mind if some invited observers from the USA could sit in on one of my sessions with my stars. Yes, of course, any time. I told my young students to expect a visit sometime, to simply ignore them, that they wouldn't have a clue what we were doing. Eventually a large group entered, sat at the back, looked suitably bemused, and left after a full hour. Later Alistair Wood - with some visiting observer from London - informed me excitedly that some of the USA observers had pledged (on the basis of what they had seen me do with my stars) half-a-million dollars to DCU. Wasn't that great? Well, yes, it was...

<br><br> Besides myself teaching one group, there was a wonderful high-school teacher (Martin Hilliard) taking a second group; Martin and I got on wonderfully well (and we still do!) and we had many a happy mathematical discussion at lunch times.

<br><br> Coming to the end of the three weeks we heard that the <i>big-wigs</i> were taking themselves off to a dinner in some fancy restaurant, but that none of us (the <i>worker bees</i>) were being asked to join them. I hope they left a big tip out of the half million dollars... That ended my days at DCU.
