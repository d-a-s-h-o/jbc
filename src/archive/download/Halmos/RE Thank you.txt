Dear John:

	We are both (?) very (??) handsome (???) - thank you for the pictures
-- and also for the picture of (even better looking) Olivia Bree. We all look good 
on my machine (colors and all), but when I printed us out, we came out black and 
white and less pretty -- I'll look into what I have to do to get colors printed.
 
	Your address ends with "ie", and I suspect I know what that is an
abbreviation of, but I have to make an effort not to read it as "that is". 

	When will y'all come to collect the drink I owe you? Correction:
drinks.

	Paul
