<p><img src="images/millprime.gif" width="216" height="314" align="left" hspace="25"
vspace="25" border="1"> New technologies create new possibilities. Early in 1999, John B.
Cosgrave, using off-the-shelf mathematical software and mathematical ideas due to H. C.
Pocklington, found a prime number with exactly 2000 digits. With the year 2000 on the
horizon, it was inevitable that the number of digits would be related to the millennium.
Cosgrave himself called it his &quot;millennium prime,&quot; and its discovery garnered
him some attention. For example, Ivars Peterson mentioned it in <a
href="/mathland/mathtrek_1_18_99.html">one of his MathTrek columns</a>. </p>

<p>Excited by his discovery, Cosgrave wrote a long email message to his niece and nephew
explaining some of the ideas that led to the discovery of the millennium prime. This email
message now forms the major portion of the booklet <i>A Prime for the Millennium</i>,
published by Folding Landscapes Press in Ireland. The booklet is charming, the story well
told, and profits from the sales go to the Irish Cancer Society. Not a bad deal at all;
check it out. <b>(Fernando Q. Gouvêa)</b></p>

<p><img src="images/smarand.gif" width="208" height="310" align="right" hspace="20"
vspace="20" border="1"> Smarandache sequences are a family of sequences of integers around
which one can formulate various number-theoretical questions. For example, on page 6 of
this book, we find the &quot;Smarandache Symmetric Sequence&quot;,</p>

<p align="center">1, 11, 121, 12321, 1234321, 123454321, ..., </p>

<p align="center">followed by the question &quot;How many primes are there in this
sequence?&quot;.</p>

<p><i>Pluckings from the Tree of Smarandache Sequences and Functions</i> is Charles
Ashbacher's third book on &quot;Smarandache Notions.&quot; In this book, he tries to make
some progress on questions such as the one above, questions which are generally very
difficult. Ashbacher plays with the various notions, obtains partial results, does
computer experiments. There are a few theorems, but mostly there are questions,
conjectures, and examples. Most of the mysteries being studied remain mysterious.</p>

<p><img src="images/grassmann.gif" width="216" height="307" align="left" hspace="20"
vspace="20"> Hermann Grassmann's <i>Extension Theory</i> (Ausdehnungslehre), first
published in 1862, is a legendary book in the history of mathematics. Extending the ideas
in his earlier book <i>Linear Extension Theory</i>, Grassmann here introduces a whole
&quot;calculus of extensive magnitudes&quot; that is one of the historical roots of modern
linear and multilinear algebra. In contrast to Grassmann's earlier book, this one is more
mathematical and less philosophical. It also goes much deeper into the subject, including
applications of Grassmann's ideas to what we would describe as multivariable calculus.
Grassmann's earlier book and some of his shorter works had already been translated into
English by Lloyd C. Kannenberg a few years ago and published as <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812692764/themathematiassoA">A New Branch of
Mathematics</a> (Open Court, 1995). Here the same translator brings us Grassmann's more
mature book. This new book in the &quot;Sources&quot; subseries is a most welcome addition
to the AMS/LMS <b>History of Mathematics</b> series. A must-buy for those seriously
interested in the history of mathematics. <b>(Fernando Q. Gouvêa)</b> </p>
