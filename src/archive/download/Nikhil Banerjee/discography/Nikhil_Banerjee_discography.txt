
Personal discography of Nikhil Banerjee recordings.

Mohan Nadkarni began his ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY OF INDIA, MARCH 9, 1986 assessment
of Nikhil Banerjee - An August Requiem (https://mohannadkarni.org/an-august-requeim/) - as follows:

" What is it that makes most of us – especially those of my generation – claim
that Nikhil Banerjee was a cut above all other sitar virtuosi of our time? "

and ended his substantial analysis thus:

"The half-a-dozen commercial discs he has cut for the Gramophone Company of
India are now all that we have to cherish and preserve as mementos of his
greatness and, let me say it again, of the best sitar maestro of our time."

Happily this is no longer the case, as there are very many commercial recordings
- LPs, cassettes, CDs - now available, not to mention a huge number of Youtube
recordings that individuals have posted over the years (I am not going to name
them, leaving it to interested persons to seek out themselves):

them, or was gifted them), CDs, and just one cassette recording:

-----------------

And now a list of all my Nikhil Banerjee CDs.

Every lover of Nikhil Banerjee's contribution to world culture should be
grateful to Raga Records (http://www.raga.com) - the wonderful New York based
company - for their extraotrdinary contribution to Nikhil Banerjee's
discography.

Raga Records have a Nikhil Banerjee discography (which covers not just their
remarkable contribution):

http://www.raga.com/discographies/discobanerjee.html

Here I only give the briefest details (complete details of every CD are
available at the Raga website) of those that I myself have(all, of course). Any
comment in square brackets [...] is my own.

17. RAGA-201. Chandrakaush and Khamaj. Mahapurusk Misra (tabla). Live-to-air
    broadcast, KPFA Berkeley, 1967 

Raga-201: NIKHIL BANERJEE sitar MAHAPURUSH MISRA (tabla)
Live-to-air broadcast, KPFA Berkeley, 1967

"My approach to music is very deep. I do not compromise with anybody or anything
else in the world. I do not care. I want to really go beyond this materialistic
world...not for the sake of enjoyment, entertainment, no. A musician must lift
up the souls of the listeners, and take them towards Space. I think when any
musician is recording, he becomes self-conscious and he cannot give his best.
But it is also true that we have lost many great musicians; now at least the
next generation can get some sort of idea of their music from these recordings.
I think that recording live concerts is a much better way." -- From the
Interview with Nikhil Banerjee in the Purabi Kalyan (Raga-207) booklet.

    (21:30) Mahapurush Misra (tabla)

-----------------

Any Youtube (owned by Google) search for Nikhil Banerjee will bring up hundreds
of returns... most of them are breakers of the record company's copyright. How
can they expect a company to produce (at expense) a Nikhil Banerjee recording
(or anyone else's for that matter) if a single copy of it may be uploaded to
Youtube (they (Google) make the profit)?

Of course I see old live recordings of Nikhil Banerjee that do not appear to
have been uploaded from a CD, but rather have (somehow) been (poorly) recorded
on an ancient cassette recorder. I could detail scores of such recordings, but I
leave it to (possible) readers of this document to discover those themselves.

I will mention but one, his truly utterly memorable (60 minute) Durga at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9asN7RfPI0 (Yes, yes, the recording quality is
poor - and there a jump at about the 30 minute mark (recorded on a 60 minute
cassette tape, and turned over?), and the ending is missing - but, it is
transcendentally beautiful...) Unfortunately its uploader - who uses a pseudonym
'Raga Rang' - gives neither date nor location of performance.

There are just so many more, enough to keep one going for a lifetime.
