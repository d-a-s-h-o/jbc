<b> A note of late March 2017. </b> 

 You may encounter a problem opening my Maple worksheets (as indeed I do myself) here at my web site - it would appear to depend on the internet 

browser being used. 

 Thus, if I attempt to open one of my worksheets using Interner Explorer there is never a problem, whereas if I use Firefox then all that one sees

 - this is just an example - is something like this: 

   {VERSION 3 0 "IBM INTEL NT" "3.0" }
{USTYLETAB {CSTYLE "Maple Input" -1 0 "Courier" 0 0 128 0 128 1 0 1 0 
0 1 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "2D Math" -1 2 "Times" 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 
0 0 }{CSTYLE "2D Comment" 2 18 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }
{CSTYLE "2D Output" 2 20 "" 0 0 0 128 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "
" -1 256 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" -1 257 "" 0 1 0 
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" -1 258 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" -1 259 "" 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }{CSTYLE "" 

and so on (almost at infinitum)... <br> 

<p> I asked Maplesoft for advice on this and they recommended doing the following (and I found it worked):

</p>

<ol>

<li> Don't attempt directly to open the worksheet (by clicking on my link), instead right click and save the worksheet to (say) the download folder.

</li> <br>

<li> Now that the worksheet is in the download folder (cut it out if you wish and put into whatever folder you wish) you may open the worksheet
     in the usual way (I should add that while I see this 'works', I have absolutely no idea as to why it does... ) [END OF NOTE].

</li> 

<br>

</ol>

<strong>

The following are worksheets presented in the academic year Sept 2000 to May 2001.

</strong> 

<strong>

I have removed all Maple output (to reduce file sizes), and so worksheets need to be re-executed

</strong>.

</p>

<p>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/sept2000.mws">sept2000.mws</a>, 

material presented at an 'Advisory session' with prospective first year students, September 2000.

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Introduction_to_inequalities.mws">Introduction to inequalities.mws</a>, 

an introduction to Inequalities. Sept/Oct 2000.

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/potatoes.mws">potatoes.mws</a>, 

an inequalities related worksheet concerned principally with numerical motivation for a volume/surface area, 
area/perimeter type inequality. 

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/program1.mws">program1.mws</a>, 

an introduction to programming, October 2000.

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/program2.mws">program2.mws</a>, 

a continuation of program1.mws, October 2000.

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Chess_solution.mws">Chess solution.mws</a>, 

a solution/discussion of the chess board problem presented in Introduction to inequalities.mws.

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Archimedes%20area/area_of_triangle.mws">area of triangle.mws</a>, 

work to illustrate the area of a triangle in terms of the co-ordinates of its vertices. I needed this area result for the following:

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Archimedes%20area/Archimedes_area.mws">Archimedes area.mws</a>, 

work to illustrate how Archimedes found the area of a parabolic sector (this work forms - in my view - an excellent path into a 
study of infinite series. It is, of course, of interest in its own right.) A related worksheet - the one I used to create the fixed 
diagrams in the Archimedes area worksheet is:

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Archimedes%20area/Archimedes_diagrams.mws">Archimedes diagrams.mws</a>

<br> <br>

A related worksheet (with output removed) is 

    <a href = "download/1st_year/infinite%20series/infinite%20series.mws">infinite series.mws</a>

<br> <br>

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2000-2001/Sequences_Limits1.mws">Sequences_Limits1.mws</a>, 

preliminary work to illustrate the meaning of the <em>limit</em> of a sequence. &nbsp;

<br> <br>

Motivated by the December 2001 MAA Monthly artice by Peter Borwein and Loki J<span lang = "EN-IE" style = "mso-ansi-language:EN-IE">ö<o:p>

</span>rgenson - <i>Visible Structures in Number Theory</i> - I have just created the following Maple worksheets 
(relevant, at the time of creation, to my first year course): 

    <a href = "download/1st_year/VISIBLE%20STRUCTURES/visible%20structures.mws">visible structures.mws</a> 

(with all output removed) and a html version 

                     <a href = "download/1st_year/VISIBLE%20STRUCTURES/visible%20structures1.html">visible structures1.html</a>. 

Of course it is only the active mws version that allows one to see the animations (oh! I have just checked, and the animations 
appear to play over and over... I don't know <i>why</i> that happens... ). For teaching purposes this work links with the 
Archimedes.mws worksheet above. I have also added a related worksheet, 

     <a href = "download/1st_year/Swineshead's%20series/Swineshead's%20sum.mws">Swineshead's sum.mws</a>, 

which - amongst other things - illustrates Oresm'es graphical derivation of the sum of what I call <i>Swineshead's series</i>. 
Here is a html version - 

    <a href = "download/1st_year/Swineshead's%20series/Swineshead's%20sum1.html">Swineshead's sum1.html</a>

- for anyone who doesn't have Maple. A related sequences worksheet is 

    <a href = "download/1st_year/2001-2002/some%20important%20limits.mws">some important limits.mws</a>.

<br> <br>

<strong>I will have many more in-term worksheets to add here when time allows.
