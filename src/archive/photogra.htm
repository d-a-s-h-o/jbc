Elsewhere in my site I have made public a number of historically valuable photographs: those of 

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/Nikhil_Banerjee.htm">Nikhil Banerjee</a> 

at his June 1985 Dublin concert, or the 

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/oxford.htm">Oxford 1969</a>  

conference on Computers and Number Theory.&nbsp;

</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40;">

There are also many photographs in the <a href = "biograph.htm">Autobiography</a>

section of my site.

Below you will find some scanned photographs (thanks to my colleague Denis Twomey for showing me how to scan) with brief comments.

I recently visited Sant' Alvise, having read Mary Laven's <i>Virgins of Venice</i> (Penguin Books; &quot;<i>Venice in the
sixteenth century was home to over fifty convents...</i>&quot;).&nbsp;

</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40;">

My wife and I also visited Burano, where I took these two photos: 

<a href = "download/photographs/Burano%20canal.jpg">Burano canal</a>

 and 

<a href = "download/photographs/B%20Galuppi.jpg">Baldassare Galuppi</a>. 

I had hoped to find the house in which Galuppi was born, but nobody in Burano seemed to know...

The <a href = "download/photographs/Dante%20plaque.jpg">plaque</a>

Galileo's former home in Florence is not (surprisingly) a museum...; rather it is a 

<i>

private

</i> 

house, with a 

<a href = "download/photographs/Galileo%20plaque.jpg">plaque</a>,

which reads:

</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40;" align = "center">

<br>

LA MAESTRA&nbsp; DI FERDINANDO II

<br>

</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40;">

The house isn't signposted, and you need to know where to find it. Two photos that I took in Florence's Santa Croce:

Some months ago I read Iris Origo's wonderful 

<i>

The Merchant [ =  Francesco Datini] of Prato

</i> 

(1957; a&nbsp; picture of late 15<font size = "3">  <sup>th</sup>  </font> century Italian life...).

Recently, while in Florence, I went to Prato to see Datini's house.

<a href = "http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~fpiper/">Fred Piper</a> 

retired recently (a substantial paper that I dedicated to Fred is available 

<a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/transcendental_numbers.htm">here</a>).

There was a 

<a href = "https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/home.aspx">Royal Holloway College</a> (RHC) 

cake-and-tea party in the college's Picture Gallery on Thurs 22 <font size = "3">  <sup>nd</sup>

</font>

Sept 2004 to mark Fred's retirement; I took a number of photos at it, but

<a href = "download/photographs/Fred's%20cake%20party.jpg">only one of them</a>

 has come out semi-decently.&nbsp;

</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40;">

While visiting RHC for Fred's retirement party, I took these photos of departmental photographs: 

<a href = "download/photographs/Fred%20Piper.jpg">Fred Piper</a>,

<a href = "download/photographs/H.G.%20Eggleston.jpg">H.G. Eggleston</a>,  

<a href = "download/photographs/W%20Mc%20Crea.jpg">W.H. McCrea</a>.

<br>

<br>

Fred taught me when I was an undergraduate (1965-68), in my first and final years; H.G. Eggleston in my second and third years (he allowed me give his
tutorials in the years 1968-1971), and W.H. McCrea interviewed me in Jan 1965 (he was joined by four others) for an undergraduate place at RHC. He was only
there for my first year, and I never had any lectures from him. W.H. McC. attended a talk that I gave in the department - in February 1966 - on my then,
just-accepted-for-publication, <i>New Proof of Wilson's Theorem</i>.&nbsp;
