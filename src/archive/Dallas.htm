<p>In March 2002 I spent two of the happiest weeks of my life in Dallas (Texas),
spending one day in each of four wonderful schools, <a href = "http://www.hockaday.org/">The
Hockaday School</a>, <a href = "https://www.smtexas.org/page">St Mark's School of Texas</a>,
<a href = "http://www.esdallas.org/">The Episcopal School of Dallas</a>, and the
Cistercian School. I also spent one afternoon at the <a href = "http://www.smu.edu/">Southern
Methodist University</a>, where I gave a talk (essentially my ideas in
connection with Fermat numbers; see <a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/fermat6.htm">Fermat
6</a>).</p>
<p>I was invited to Dallas by Drs Jim Huth and Susan Tucker (two eminent
surgeons), after they had read my <a href = "http://johnbcosgrave.com/archive/talented.htm">Talented
Youth paper</a>. Jim and Susan gave Mary and I the 'time of our lives', and,
while we were there, we had a two day visit from our friends Pat and <a href = "http://aftermath.math.ou.edu/~pgoodey/">Paul
Goodey</a>, who came down from Norman, Oklahoma, to be with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would not be possible to record what I did in each of the four schools,
and I will only say that I found the level of response from all the students
(and their teachers!) to be exhilirating (it took me many, many weeks to come
back to earth after I had left).</p>
<p>I spent Wed 13th March in the Hockaday School. Near the end of the day, Julie
- Jim and Susan's daughter - told me that Liza Lee, the school's headmistress,
would like to meet me when I was finished teaching; I expected a brief meeting,
and no more. How wrong I was...</p>
<p>When we met we had a very long conversation, and at one point she asked me if
I knew of a mathematician called '<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_G._Macdonald">Ian
MacDonald</a>'. Well, yes I did: Ian used to be my (wonderful) head of
department when I held a two year appointment (1972-74) at Manchester
University. And how did she know of Ian MacDonald? She and her husband had met
him at dinner in London, one year when they had spent a year there (if I
remember correctly).</p>
<p>At one point I mentioned that in Jim and Susan's home (where Mary and I were
staying) I had seen a book marking the 50th anniversary (in 1963) of the
founding of the Hockaday School, and I wondered if perhaps there had been a
similar publication marking the 75th anniversary, and, if so, would it be
possible for me to obtain a copy? Ms Lee told me there had been such a
publication (OF HEARTS AND MINDS, The Hockaday Experience (1913-1988)), but that
copies were no longer be available...</p>
<p>Ms Lee left me for a moment, went into her office, and brought out a copy for
me to see. It was a rather special copy, being autographed over six pages by
some of the school's (small number of) boarders. Handing the book back to her,
Ms Lee said a most generous thing; she said<i> it was for me, to keep, as a
present</i>...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I protested that I <i>couldn't possibly</i> accept <i>such a gift</i>, which
was so clearly a part of the school's history. But Ms Lee insisted it was a gift
to me, and it would have been bad manners of me not to have accepted. And accept
it I did.</p>
<p>One day I shall have that copy returned to the Hockaday School, but in the
meantime here are some twenty-one pages - in sequence - which I have scanned
from it, including the six autographed pages. I hope I will be forgiven for
cropping many of the generous margins (in the hope of improving the quality of
the scans).</p>
